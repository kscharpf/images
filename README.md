Some fun with java image processing
- ImageConverter.java - encodes an image file as java source code using only the Graphics.fillRect method.
- EdgeDetecter.java - converts an image to gray-scale and performs a few smoothing operations before deploying the Sobel operator to establish the gradient.  Optionally uses a binary threshold of the gradient image.
